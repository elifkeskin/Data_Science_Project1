## 📈 About the Project
This is a comprehensive **end-to-end** data science project based on a real-world dataset.  

- **Objective**: The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer is likely to file a car insurance claim based on their demographic and vehicle-related information.
This is formulated as a binary classification problem where the target variable Outcome indicates whether a claim was made (1) or not (0).

- **Scope**: Includes data collection, preprocessing, exploration, modeling, evaluation, and visualization.


## ⏳ Project Status
- **Ongoing** – The project is actively being developed and enhanced.
  
- ✅ Completed:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Data preprocessing & feature engineering
    
- 🔜 Next Steps:
  - Model selection & hyperparameter tuning
  - Model benchmarking
  - Preparing the final model for production



## 📂 Dataset
